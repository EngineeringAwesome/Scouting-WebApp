Scouting-WebApp
===============

A repository for a scouting app that runs in a internet browser.  Runs on HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, and more


TODO: Add folders for CSS, JS, and Resources
TODO: Add a file in Resources that is the template for the user's logo
TODO: Adda file in the Resources that a script could read from to change the theme, colors, fonts, etc in a user friendly way


Idea:  Model this after Wordpress's back end.  Users could change logo, change colors, fonts, etc with a simple user interface
       (would be an easy way to change code to FRC scouting for ASAP)
